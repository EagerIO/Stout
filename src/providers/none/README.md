# none

The none provider provides CDN. Or rather, it doesn't. It simply forgoes the option to use a CDN, and makes your users directly access your FS provider to view your website.

Using this provider is discouraged, but exists if you'd rather not use a CDN.

There are no options or config for this provider.
